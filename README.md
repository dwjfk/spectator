A simple program to create K8s podspecs

Although I am all for creating JSON files to describe the Kubernetes resources I need, creating them over and over for multiple clones is a chore. Also, writing the podspec in the first place can be tedious, always using the python tool to fix my JSON errors, trying to remember where I need to put things like volume specifiers, etc. 
This tool aims to help with that.
