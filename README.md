A simple program to create K8s podspecs

Although I am all for creating JSON files to describe the resources I need in kubernetes, Creating them over and over for multiple clones is a chore. Also, writing the podspec in the first place can be tedious, always using the python tool to fix my JSON errors, trying to remember where I need to put things like volume sepcifiers, etc. 
this tool aims to help with that.
